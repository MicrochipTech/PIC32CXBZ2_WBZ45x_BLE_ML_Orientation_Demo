# PIC32CXBZ2_WBZ45x_BLE_ML_Orientation_Demo
This application shows how to use TensorFlow Lite to build a basic machine learning application on a PIC32CX-BZ2 / WBZ451 device.   The application classifies the orientation of the WBZ451 Curiosity board using a pretrained TensorFlow model, and then sends the classification result to an MBD App.
